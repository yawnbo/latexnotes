\section*{Bonus question, generalization of type II integral.}%
Starting with the general integral
\[
\int_{0}^{a>0} \frac{dx}{x^{p}}
.\] 
We can find that our denominator cannot be 0 so, our lower bound needs to be evaluated as a limit and we need to rewrite the integral.
\[
\lim_{T \to 0^{+}} \int_{T}^{a} x^{-p}dx \implies \lim_{T \to 0^{+}} \left( \frac{x^{-p+1}}{-p+1} \right) \Big|_{T}^{a}
.\] 
Now we plug in values and evaluate our new expression
\[
\lim_{R \to 0^{+}} \left( \frac{a^{-p+1}}{1-p}- \frac{R^{-p+1}}{1-p} \right) 
.\] 
The limit cancels one of our terms and we are left with
\[
\frac{a^{-p+1}}{1-p}
.\]
