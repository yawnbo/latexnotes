\begin{document}
\section*{Section 1}%
\label{sec:Section 1}
\paragraph{Estimating net change with a sum for distance or displacement, estimating $\int_{}^{} $ using $R_n$ or $K_{n}$ or $m_{n}$, maybe differential eqs., maybe reimann sums, differentiating the accumlation function using FTC, PROBLEM 7 on the exam where graph is given and mins and things are found, basic u substitution. }

\section*{Section 2}%
\label{sec:Section 2}
\paragraph{Shell washer and disk methods should be known for volume calculations, area between 2 graphs, average value of function (look for the picture ones where slopes are very defined on the graph), find the volume by cross sectional areas (word problem), hooks law ($f=kx$ or the spring one), work for pumping water out of shape (no bucket and rope problem), }

  \section*{Part 3}%
  \label{sec:Part 3}
  \paragraph{Will include, IBP, maybe trig int, partial fractions, DEF comparison with a known divergence or convergence. All this with impropers somewhere along the path}
