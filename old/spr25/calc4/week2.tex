\section{Question 1}%
\label{sec: Question 1 }
\paragraph{Find the parametric equation of the line through $ \left( 1,-3,4 \right)  $ that is parallel to the line $ x=3+4t, y=5-t, z=7 $. \\ \\}

Finding the direction of our vector we take the coefficients of t,
\[
\vec{ v }= < 4,-1,0 >
.\] 
Since this is parallel to our solution vector we know they are the same and can just use our given points as offsets to get the equation
\[
x=1+4t, y=-3-t, z=4
.\] 

\section{Question 2}%
\label{sec: Question 2 }
\paragraph{Determine whether the following pairs of lines are parallel, intersect at a single point, or are skew.}
\begin{gather*}
l_1: x=4, y=6 -t, z=1+t \\
l_2: x=-3-7s, y=1+4s,z=4-s
\end{gather*}

Looking at the coefficients of our t and s values we can write their directional vectors as
\[
\vec{ t }= < 0,-1,1 > \text{ and } \vec{ s }= < -7,4,-1 >
\] 
Which will not be parallel to each other. Checking if they interest we can set them equal to each other and solve for our variables
\[
4= -3-7s \implies 7s= -7 \implies s= -1
.\] 
\[
6-t= 1+4s \implies -t= 4-4 \implies t= 0
.\] 
Before even going to our z coordinate we can see that there is no point in time where these two coordinates match and we can conclude our lines are skew.

\section{Question 3}%
\label{sec: Question 3 }
\paragraph{Find the distance between the point $ Q\left( 5,6,1 \right)  $ and the line $ x=1+3t,y=3-4t,z=t+1 $}
First we can find our directional vector to be $ \vec{ v } = \langle 3,4,1 \rangle $ and we can find our vector from the point to the line to be
\[
\vec{ QP } = \langle \left( 1+3t \right) -5,\left( 3-4t \right) -6,\left( t-1 \right) -1 \rangle = \langle 3t-4,-4t-3,t \rangle
.\] 	
Now using the distance formula,
\[
	D=\frac{ \left| \vec{ QP } \times v \right| }{ \left| v \right| }
.\] 
We first find our cross product as the matrix
\[
	\begin{bmatrix} i & j & k \\ 3t-4 & -4t-3 & t \\ 3 & -4 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \implies i\left( \left( -4t-3 \right) + 4t \right) -j\left( \left( 3t-4 \right) -3t \right) + k\left( \left( -12t+16 \right) +12t+9 \right) 
.\] 
Now taking the magnitude of our vector,
\[
\left| -3i+4j+25k \right| = \sqrt{ 9+16+625 } = \sqrt{ 650 } = 5\sqrt{ 26 }
.\] 
And our directional vector,
\[
\left| \vec{ v } \right| = \sqrt{ 3^2+4^2+1^2 } = \sqrt{ 26 }
.\] 
Leaving us with 
\[
\frac{ 5 \cancel{ \sqrt{ 26 }  } }{ \cancel{ \sqrt{ 26 }  } } = 5
.\] 
So the distance between the point and the line is 5 units.

\section{Question 4}%
\label{sec: Question 4 }
\paragraph{Find and equation of a plane passing through the point $ \left( 2,-3,5 \right)  $ that is perpendicular to the line $ x=2t,y=1+3t,z=5+4t $. \\ \\}
We start by finding our normal vector to be $ 2,3,4 $ and, we can use the formula of plane to find it to be 
\[
	2\left( x - 2 \right) + 3\left( y+3 \right) + 4\left( z-5 \right) = 0 \to 2x-4+3y+9+4z-20=0 \to 2x+3y+4z-15=0
.\] 
With the final equation for the plane being 
\[
2x+3y+4z=15
.\] 


\section{Question 5}%
\label{sec: Question 5 }
\paragraph{Find an equation of the line of intersection of the plane $ Q:-x+2y+z=1 $ and $ R:x+y+z=0 $. \\ \\}
Since we want to find a line of intersection we can normalize both planes and find our vector of intersection with cross products,
\[
\vec{ n_Q }= \langle -1,2,1 \rangle \text{ and } \vec{ n_R }= \langle 1,1,1 \rangle
.\] 
\[
\vec{ n_Q } \times \vec{ n_R } = \begin{bmatrix} i & j & k \\ -1 & 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = i\left( 2-1 \right) -j\left( -1-1 \right) +k\left( -1-2 \right) = i+2j-3k \implies \vec{ v }= \langle 1,2,-3 \rangle
.\] 
Now we need to find any point that can satisfy our equation which can be easily done by setting z to zero and solving,
\[
Q \implies -x+2y=1 \implies x=2y-1
.\] 
\[
R \implies x+y=0 \implies y= -x
.\] 
Plugging in,
\[
	-\left( -y \right) +2y=1 \implies y= \frac{ 1 }{ 3 }  \implies x= -\frac{ 1 }{ 3 } 
.\] 
Now that we have all our factors we can write our new system as
\[
x=-\frac{ 1 }{ 3 } +t, y=\frac{ 1 }{ 3 } +2t, z=-3t
.\]
